                <h3>Python</h3>
                <p>I have a solid foundation in Python and have experience working with APIs and building small games, and useful programs like a flashcard app and an app that tracks the ISS. Through my experience, I have gained a strong understanding of key programming concepts such as data structures, control flow, and error handling. Working with APIs has allowed me to integrate with external systems and develop a deep understanding of concepts such as data formats and authentication. Building games has also honed my creativity and problem-solving skills in a way that engages users. Overall, my experience in Python demonstrates a balance of technical skills and practical application, making me a strong candidate for roles that require a solid foundation in programming.</p>

              <h3>Outdoors</h3>
              <p>I've always been an outdoor enthusiast and love to go on hikes. During the winter months I love to hit the slopes and carve my way down the mountain on my snowboard. In addition to hiking and snowboarding, I'm also an avid boater and enjoy spending time on the water.  Another activity that I enjoy is fishing, and I love nothing more than spending a day by the lake, river, or ocean, casting my line and waiting for the big catch. </p>
